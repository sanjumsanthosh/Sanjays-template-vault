# Adding intresting read and thnkoutloud 

if you find anything which is an intrestng read but now you don't have time to read it, you can add it to the intresting read section.

just do like this 
```
- [ ] This is somethig intresting check it out #interesting-read
```

Same goes for the thnkoutloud section, i.e, if you want to write or do something but you don't have time to do it now, you can add it to the thnkoutloud section.

just do like this 
```
- [ ] This is somethig intresting to do / write #ThnkOutLoud
```

This will be in the to-dos.md file / in the cardboard view .
